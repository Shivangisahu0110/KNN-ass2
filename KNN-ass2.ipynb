    "## How These Differences Affect KNN Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sensitivity to Feature Scale:\n",
    "\n",
    "Euclidean Distance: Since it squares the differences, it is very sensitive to the magnitude of the differences. If the features are not normalized, the feature with the largest range can dominate the distance computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Manhattan Distance: It is less sensitive to the scale of the features because it sums the absolute differences. However, it can still be affected by varying scales of different features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Impact of Outliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Euclidean Distance: More affected by outliers due to squaring the differences, which magnifies the impact of large differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Manhattan Distance: Less affected by outliers since it sums the absolute differences without squaring them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dimensionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "Euclidean Distance: In high-dimensional spaces, the Euclidean distance can become less discriminative because the distances between points tend to become more similar (the curse of dimensionality).\n",
    "\n",
    "Manhattan Distance: Can be more robust in high-dimensional spaces as it considers the sum of absolute differences, which might maintain better discriminability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Decision Boundaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "Euclidean Distance: Produces circular or spherical decision boundaries (in higher dimensions, hyperspherical).\n",
    "\n",
    "Manhattan Distance: Produces square or diamond-shaped decision boundaries (in higher dimensions, hypercubic).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance Impact in KNN Classifier or Regressor\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Characteristics:\n",
    "The performance impact of using Euclidean vs. Manhattan distance in KNN largely depends on the characteristics of the data. For data with features on different scales or with significant outliers, Manhattan distance might perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Normalization:\n",
    "If the features are normalized (e.g., via z-score normalization or min-max scaling), the difference in performance between Euclidean and Manhattan distance might be less pronounced.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dimensionality:\n",
    "In high-dimensional spaces, Manhattan distance might sometimes provide more meaningful distances between points than Euclidean distance due to the curse of dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Computational Complexity:\n",
    "Both distance metrics have similar computational complexity for a single distance computation, but the impact on overall KNN performance also depends on the dataset size and dimensionality."
